                <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
                <p> <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> 15 October 1931-27 July 2015 was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>

                        Kalam’s career as a scientist began in earnest in 1965 when he joined the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).

                        In 1969, APJ Abdul Kalam was transferred to the Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL) in Hyderabad, where he worked on the development of India’s first satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III).

                    <li>
                        The SLV-III was a remarkable achievement for India, as it made India the sixth country in the world to have a satellite launch capability.

                        Kalam’s biggest achievement, however, came in 1983 when he became the director of the DRDO’s Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme IGMDP.

                        Under his leadership, the programme developed five missile systems, including the Agni, Prithvi, Akash, Nag, and Trishul missiles.

                    <li>
                        These missiles were significant for India as they gave the country a credible deterrent against its neighbors, particularly Pakistan and China.

                    <li>
                        APJ Abdul Kalam was widely recognized as the “Missile Man of India” for his role in developing these missile systems.

                        Kalam’s contributions to Indian science and technology did not end with the missile programme. APJ Abdul Kalam also played a critical role in the development of India’s nuclear program.

                    <li>
                        In 1998, India conducted its first nuclear tests under Kalam’s guidance, making India a nuclear power.

                    <li>
                        Aside from his scientific achievements, Kalam was also a devoted educator and mentor to young people.

                    <li>
                        APJ Abdul Kalam believed that education was the key to unlocking India’s potential and that every child deserved the opportunity to receive an education.

                        APJ Abdul Kalam frequently spoke at schools and universities, inspiring students with his words and encouraging them to pursue their dreams. Kalam also authored several books, including his autobiography “Wings of Fire,” which became a bestseller in India
